# ANALYSING 6 TRANSPORT DATASETS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS

## Introduction

This is a data cleaning and visualization project that cleanses and combines 6 datasets into three to find answers to some questions about US air transportation.

## Problem Statement

The questions answered are:
1. What is the trend of on-time flight movements?
2. How does load-factor vary with on-time flight performances?
3. What is the share of Domestic and International flights in revenue and profits?
4. What is the distribution of sector-wise flight operations in profit and revenue percentages?

## Data

The datafiles are present in the repository in CSV format.

1. Flights.csv - contains the numbers of annual flight operations - domestic and international.
2. LoadFactor.csv - contains the monthly load factors from year 2003-2017
3. On-Time-Data.csv - contains the annual time performance of all flight operations form 1995-2017
4. Operating_ProfitLoss.csv - contains the quarterly profit/loss of all airlines combined from 2000-2017
5. Operating_Revenue.csv - contains the quarterly revenue of all airlines combined from 2000-2017
6. Passengers.csv - contains the monthly passenger count for all airlines combined from 2002-2017
